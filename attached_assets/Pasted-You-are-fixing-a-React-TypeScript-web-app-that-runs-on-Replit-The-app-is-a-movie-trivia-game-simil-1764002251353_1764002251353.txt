You are fixing a React/TypeScript web app that runs on Replit. The app is a movie trivia game (similar to “Krittics” or “Krossfire”) that shows an “End-of-Movie Deep Dive Trivia” splash screen with a countdown timer and a “Start Trivia Now” button.

Current problems:

1. Layout doesn’t fit on mobile screens
   - There is a large trophy/achievement banner at the very top (outside the main game card) that wastes a lot of vertical space.
   - On iPhone/Android portrait mode, the main card is too tall: the title “End-of-Movie Deep Dive Trivia”, the description text, the countdown “Up next in 18 seconds…”, and the three buttons (“Republish”, “Preview”, “Start Trivia Now”) get cut off or require scrolling.
   - I need EVERYTHING (all text + all 3 buttons) to be fully visible without scrolling on a standard iPhone 12/13/14/15 screen (height ≈ 812–896 px).

2. Countdown bug
   - When the 18-second countdown reaches 0, nothing happens. It just stays at 0.
   - It should automatically start playing a new random movie clip (the same behavior as pressing “Start Trivia Now”).

Please rewrite the relevant component(s) so that:

- The trophy/achievement bar at the top is completely removed or hidden on this specific screen (it’s unnecessary here).
- The entire content uses a responsive, compact layout that fits entirely within the viewport on mobile.
- Maximum use of flexbox, reduced font sizes on mobile, reduced padding/margins, and smaller button heights.
- The three buttons at the top (“Republish”, “Preview”, and the three-dot menu) must stay visible.
- The main “Start Trivia Now” button stays prominent at the bottom.
- The countdown actually triggers the start of a new random movie when it hits 0 (call the same function that “Start Trivia Now” calls, usually something like startNewGame(), playRandomMovie(), or handleStartTrivia()).

Current typical structure (simplified):

<div className="app">
  <AchievementBanner />   ←←← REMOVE THIS ON THIS SCREEN
  <HeaderWithButtons />   ← contains Republish, Preview, ⋮
  <div className="main-card">
    <h1>End-of-Movie Deep Dive Trivia</h1>
    <p>Test your recall on Tears of Steel’s plot, quotes...</p>
    <p className="countdown">Up next in {seconds} seconds…</p>
    <button className="start-button">Start Trivia Now</button>
  </div>
</div>

Please provide the complete fixed component code (or the minimal set of changes) that:
- Conditionally hides or removes the trophy/AchievementBanner on this specific route/screen
- Uses proper responsive CSS (preferably Tailwind or CSS modules) to shrink everything so it fits on mobile
- Decreases font sizes on small screens (text-base → text-sm, text-5xl → text-3xl or text-4xl, etc.)
- Reduces vertical padding and margins
- Makes the countdown automatically trigger the trivia start when it reaches 0 (use an useEffect that watches the seconds variable)

Include any necessary imports and make sure the countdown logic calls the exact same function as the manual button (e.g., startTrivia(), nextMovie(), etc. – keep the original function name from the project).

Make the layout beautiful but extremely compact for mobile. Target: everything visible on an iPhone SE (667px height) and taller devices without any scrolling.
