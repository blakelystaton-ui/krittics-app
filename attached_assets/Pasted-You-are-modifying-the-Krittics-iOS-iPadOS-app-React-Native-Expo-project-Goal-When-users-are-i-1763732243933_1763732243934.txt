You are modifying the Krittics iOS/iPadOS app (React Native + Expo project).

Goal: When users are in a "Crew" watch session (watching a movie together with friends), implement a beautiful, modern floating chat that appears only during active Crew movie playback.

Specific requirements:

1. Floating Message Input Bar (always visible at the bottom)
   - Fixed at the very bottom of the screen, just above the iOS home indicator / safe area (like YouTube or Twitch chat)
   - Height: 50px (or 56px on iPhone)
   - Background: blur effect (translucent black or dark vibrancy)
   - Contains: Text input field (rounded, with light border) + send button (blue circle with paper plane icon)
   - When keyboard opens, the input bar should stay pinned on top of the keyboard (use KeyboardAvoidingView or native behavior)

2. Chat Messages Overlay (floating over the video)
   - Messages appear from the bottom (just above the input bar) and slowly float/fade upwards toward the center of the video
   - Each message is a rounded bubble with slight transparency (background rgba(0,0,0,0.45), white text)
   - Messages have a max-width of ~80% of screen
   - Animation: 
     - Enter from bottom with opacity 0 → 1
     - Move upward slowly (e.g., translateY -150 over 8–10 seconds)
     - Fade out completely (opacity → 0) in the last 2 seconds
     - Then remove from DOM
   - Messages should stack vertically with small spacing if multiple arrive at once
   - Do not block video controls (play/pause, scrubber, etc.)

3. Only show this floating chat when:
   - User is in a Crew room
   - A video is currently playing (or paused) in the full-screen player
   - Hide it completely on regular browse/feed mode

4. Reuse the existing room chat messages (already coming from Firestore/WebSocket) — just change the rendering location and style.

5. Make sure it works perfectly on both iPhone and iPad (responsive, respects safe areas).

Technical details:
- Use React Native Reanimated 3 + React Native Gesture Handler if needed for smooth animations
- Use expo-blur for the input bar background
- Use Moti (or Reanimated) for the floating message animations
- Position: absolute, z-index above video player but below top controls

Implement this now in the file where the Crew video player is rendered (likely components/CrewPlayer.js or screens/CrewWatchScreen.js). Show me the exact code changes.
