You are modifying the Kritiks mobile web app (React + TypeScript code base).

Current unwanted behavior:
- After a movie ends, the user is shown the "End-of-Movie Deep Dive Trivia" screen.
- This screen has two buttons: "Start Trivia Now" and "Back to Browse".
- When the user taps "Back to Browse" on this screen, instead of immediately returning to the main Browse tab/screen, it incorrectly navigates to a separate intermediate "Up next in 60 seconds..." countdown screen (second screenshot).
- The "Up next in 60 seconds..." screen also has its own "Back to Browse" button that finally works correctly.

Desired behavior:
1. Merge the countdown into the "End-of-Movie Deep Dive Trivia" screen. There should no longer be a separate "Up next in 60 seconds..." page at all.
2. The "End-of-Movie Deep Dive Trivia" screen must now display:
   - The existing trivia headline and text
   - A live countdown timer that says "Up next in XX seconds..." (decrementing every second, same style as the current separate screen)
   - THREE buttons at the bottom (all visible at the same time):
     - "Start Trivia Now" (primary, glowing style, same as current)
     - "Continue watching" → this immediately starts playing a new random movie (same behavior as the current "Continue watching" button on the intermediate screen)
     - "Back to Browse" → this immediately navigates the user back to the main Browse tab/screen (exactly like the working one on the current intermediate screen)
3. When the user taps "Back to Browse" on this new combined screen, it must directly go to Browse — NO intermediate countdown page.
4. If the countdown reaches 0 and the user has not pressed any button, automatically trigger "Continue watching" (start the next random movie).
5. Layout: the countdown text should appear centered below the trivia description and above the three buttons (similar visual placement to the current separate screen).
6. Keep the existing "Deep Dive Trivia Ready!" top banner if it exists.

Implement this change in the relevant component (likely EndOfMovieTriviaScreen, PostMovieScreen, or similar) and remove or redirect the old separate "UpNextCountdown" component/page so it is never shown again.

Make sure all navigation uses the existing navigation methods (react-navigation or whatever the project uses) and that "Back to Browse" correctly resets the stack or switches to the Browse tab.
